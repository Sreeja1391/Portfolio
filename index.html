In the journey of my graduation I succefully secured an internship in AwishION Electromob Solutions and worked there as project intern where I built an andriod application that enables students and professionals to share their technical projects on a social media like platform. In this role I gained a lot of skills which were useful for team work and collaborated with other interns where I got live project experience.<br>

Coming to my projects, recently in the month of november 2019 I did  a sorting program for large data sets. This was my personal project where I built a program that sorts large data sets using python modules and in Jan 2019 I did Multi-Level Car parking system. This was my course project where we used OOPS concept through java. In this project we developed a dynamic system to handle automated vehicular parking using principles of OOPS and going back to october 2018 I did another course project which was the back end support for simplified banking module this was a course project using C language where we implemented an algorithm that handles operations in simplified banking system.<br>
